# Main-Project-Server
 
This project helps refocus users who get distracted while completing their work. It does this by tracking the user's attentiveness using a combination of computer usage (is the user interacting with the KB + Mouse), gaze (where the user is looking), and position (has the user left the workspace). If the user is not paying attention according to any of these metrics, a sound will be played from the Hololens telling them to focus.
